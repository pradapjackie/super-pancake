### ‚úÖ Assertions

Use assertion methods from `super-pancake-automation/core/assert.js`:

```js
import {
  assertEqual,
  assertNotEqual,
  assertDeepEqual,
  assertExists,
  assertNotExists,
  assertTrue,
  assertFalse,
  assertContainsText,
  assertNotContainsText,
  assertGreaterThan,
  assertGreaterThanOrEqual,
  assertLessThan,
  assertLessThanOrEqual,
  assertTypeOf,
  assertInstanceOf,
  assertArrayIncludes,
  assertArrayNotIncludes,
  assertLength,
  assertMatch,
  assertNotMatch,
  assertVisible,
  assertExists as assertElementExists
} from 'super-pancake-automation/core/assert.js';
```

| Assertion Function            | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `assertEqual(a, b)`          | Checks if values are strictly equal |

| `assertDeepEqual(a, b)`      | Checks deep equality between objects |
| `assertExists(val)`          | Verifies that value is not null or undefined |
| `assertNotExists(val)`       | Ensures value is null or undefined |

| `assertFalse(cond)`          | Asserts condition is false |
| `assertContainsText(actual, expected)` | Checks if string contains a substring |
| `assertNotContainsText(actual, expected)` | Ensures string does not contain substring |
| `assertGreaterThan(val, threshold)` | Checks if value is greater than threshold |
| `assertGreaterThanOrEqual(val, threshold)` | Value is greater than or equal to threshold |

## üöÄ Getting Started with Super Pancake

To quickly get up and running with Super Pancake, use the following steps:

### 1. Scaffold Your Project

```bash
npm init super-pancake
```

You'll be prompted to configure your test setup:

- Choose JavaScript or TypeScript (default is JavaScript)
- Name your tests folder (default is `tests`)
- Choose whether to add example test cases
- Optionally set up Git hooks and CI config
- Decide whether to auto-install dependencies (recommended)

### 2. What Gets Installed

The setup will scaffold the following:

```
package.json
test.config.js
tests/
  sample.test.js
core/
  dom.js
  assert.js
scripts/
  test-ui.js
test-report/
  results/
  index.html
```

### 3. Running Tests

By default, test files in the `tests/` directory are picked up and run using Vitest.

To run all tests:
```bash
npx super-pancake-run
```

To run a specific test file:
```bash
npx super-pancake-run tests/form.test.js
```

To run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npx vitest --watch
```

### 4. View HTML Reports

After tests complete, an HTML report is available at:

```
test-report/index.html
```

Open it manually in your browser, or use:

```bash
npx super-pancake-show-report
```

The report includes:

- Pass/fail/skipped stats
- Screenshots (if captured)
- Logs and error stack traces

### 5. UI Mode

To run tests with a visual UI:

```bash
npx super-pancake-ui
```

This opens a browser-based dashboard where you can:

- Select tests to run
- View live logs and outputs
- Rerun individual test cases

### 6. Updating Super Pancake

To update to the latest version:

```bash
npm install super-pancake-automation@latest
```

Ensure your test cases remain compatible with any new API features or changes.

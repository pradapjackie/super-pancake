## Project Overview

This is **Super Pancake Automation** - a lightweight DOM-based UI automation framework using Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). The framework provides a simple API for browser automation, testing, and reporting.

## Key Commands

### Testing
- `npm test` - Run all tests using Vitest
- `npx super-pancake-run` - Run tests with custom runner and formatted output
- `npx super-pancake-ui` - Launch interactive test runner web UI
- `npx super-pancake-generate` - Generate sample test files
- `npx domtest` - Run basic DOM test with CLI (supports `--url=` parameter)

### Development
- Tests are located in `tests/` directory
- Use `npx vitest --watch` for watch mode during development
- Test reports are generated in `test-report/` directory with HTML output

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Browser Management (`core/browser.js`)**
- Manages Chrome DevTools Protocol connection
- Handles WebSocket communication with Chrome instances
- Waits for debugger readiness before connecting

**Session Management (`core/session.js`)**
- Creates CDP sessions with message ID tracking
- Provides promise-based API for CDP commands
- Handles WebSocket message routing

**DOM Interactions (`core/dom.js`)**
- Comprehensive DOM manipulation API (click, type, select, etc.)
- Element querying and waiting functionality
- Screenshot capture capabilities
- Navigation and page lifecycle management

**Assertions (`core/assert.js`)**
- Custom assertion library for test validation
- Supports text, element, and value assertions
- Provides detailed error messages

**Reporting System (`reporter/htmlReporter.js`)**
- Generates HTML test reports with screenshots
- Manages test result collection globally
- Handles report directory initialization

**Test Wrapper (`helpers/testWrapper.js`)**
- Integrates tests with reporting system
- Automatic screenshot capture on test failures
- Manages test lifecycle and cleanup

### Configuration

**`config.js`** - Central configuration for:
- Browser settings (Chrome port, headless mode)
- Timeout configurations (test, navigation, selectors)
- Polling intervals for DOM queries

### Test Structure

Tests use Vitest framework with custom CDP integration:
- `beforeAll()` - Launch Chrome, establish connection, create session
- `afterAll()` - Close connection, kill Chrome, generate reports
- Each test wrapped with `testWithReport()` for automatic reporting

### CLI Tools

**`bin/super-pancake-run.js`** - Main test runner:
- Cleans previous results
- Executes Vitest with custom formatting
- Provides detailed test summary tables

**`bin/ui-runner.js`** - Web UI launcher for interactive testing
**`bin/generate-test.js`** - Sample test file generator
**`bin/cli.js`** - Basic CLI tool for running single tests with URL parameter

## Development Notes

- Framework uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- CDP communication is Promise-based with async/await
- Tests require Chrome to be available for launching
- All DOM operations are wrapped in try/catch with descriptive error messages
- Screenshot capture is automatic on test failures
- HTML reports include test results, screenshots, and timestamps

## Package Export Structure

The framework exports modules via package.json `exports` field:
- Main entry: `index.js` (exports all core modules)
- Individual modules can be imported directly:
    - `super-pancake-automation/core/dom.js`
    - `super-pancake-automation/core/assert.js`
    - `super-pancake-automation/utils/launcher.js`
    - `super-pancake-automation/reporter/htmlReporter.js`
    - And more as defined in package.json exports

## Dependencies

**Runtime Dependencies:**
- `chrome-launcher` - Chrome browser launching
- `express` - Web server for UI mode
- `glob` - File pattern matching
- `node-fetch` - HTTP requests
- `open` - Opening URLs/files
- `ws` - WebSocket communication

**Dev Dependencies:**
- `vitest` - Testing framework

## üöÄ Getting Started with Super Pancake

To quickly get up and running with Super Pancake, use the following steps:

### 1. Scaffold Your Project

```bash
npm init super-pancake
```

You'll be prompted to configure your test setup:

- Choose JavaScript or TypeScript (default is JavaScript)
- Name your tests folder (default is `tests`)
- Choose whether to add example test cases
- Optionally set up Git hooks and CI config
- Decide whether to auto-install dependencies (recommended)

### 2. What Gets Installed

The setup will scaffold the following:

```
package.json
test.config.js
tests/
  sample.test.js
core/
  dom.js
  assert.js
scripts/
  test-ui.js
test-report/
  results/
  index.html
```

### 3. Running Tests

By default, test files in the `tests/` directory are picked up and run using Vitest.

To run all tests:
```bash
npx super-pancake-run
```

To run a specific test file:
```bash
npx super-pancake-run tests/form.test.js
```

To run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npx vitest --watch
```

### 4. View HTML Reports

After tests complete, an HTML report is available at:

```
test-report/index.html
```

Open it manually in your browser, or use:

```bash
npx super-pancake-show-report
```

The report includes:

- Pass/fail/skipped stats
- Screenshots (if captured)
- Logs and error stack traces

### 5. UI Mode

To run tests with a visual UI:

```bash
npx super-pancake-ui
```

This opens a browser-based dashboard where you can:

- Select tests to run
- View live logs and outputs
- Rerun individual test cases

### 6. Updating Super Pancake

To update to the latest version:

```bash
npm install super-pancake-automation@latest
```

Ensure your test cases remain compatible with any new API features or changes.
